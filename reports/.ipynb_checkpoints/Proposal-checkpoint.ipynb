    "# Project description\n",
    "\n",
    "As my final project I will atempt to create a model that predicts white wine quality based on its chemical properties. Hence, **the target variable is wine quality**.\n",
    "\n",
    "The problem can be viewed as both regression or classification depending whether we view the wine quality as a continuous or discrete feature. We will approach the problem as a **classification** task because usually people use a discrete scale to describe how much they like something.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The problem is interesting because it attempts to investigate the **objective characteristics** of a wine that people enjoy. If it turns out that perceived wine quality can be predicted from its chemical properties, the results might be impactful for wine producers (who will gain some insight how to produce better wines) and also for consumers (wishing to maximize their wine satisfaction). On the other hand, if it is the case that people's wine preference are independent from it's chemical properties then it would be an interesting result from a psychological perspective."

The authors reported that the use of SVM outperformed regression and neural networks.\n",
